# 🔴 CRITICAL: Your Browser is Showing OLD Cached Code

## ✅ Server Status (100% Verified):

- **Git**: Latest code pushed (commit `6137012`)
- **File**: Has 4 date/time fields (Start Date, Start Time, End Date, End Time)
- **Build**: Fresh build completed
- **PM2**: Running (serving new code)
- **Nginx**: Running
- **Deployment**: COMPLETE

## 🔴 The Problem:

Your browser downloaded the OLD JavaScript file and cached it. It won't download the new one because it thinks it already has the latest version.

The modal with "Status/Category/Due Date" is from the OLD cached JavaScript file.

## ✅ SOLUTION - Try ALL Methods Below:

### Method 1: Service Worker Clear (BEST)

1. Visit: `chrome://serviceworker-internals/`
2. Find `focus-project.co.uk`
3. Click **"Unregister"** for all entries
4. Close ALL tabs
5. Visit: https://focus-project.co.uk/personal
6. Click "+ New Task"

### Method 2: Complete Cache Clear

1. Type in address bar: `chrome://settings/clearBrowserData`
2. Select: **"All time"**
3. Check ALL boxes:
   - Browsing history
   - Cookies and site data
   - Cached images and files
4. Click **"Clear data"**
5. Close browser COMPLETELY
6. Reopen and visit: https://focus-project.co.uk/personal

### Method 3: Disable Cache in DevTools

1. Visit: https://focus-project.co.uk/personal
2. Press **F12** (open DevTools)
3. Press **Ctrl + Shift + P** (command palette)
4. Type: "disable cache"
5. Select: "Disable cache (while DevTools is open)"
6. Keep DevTools OPEN
7. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R**
8. Click "+ New Task"

### Method 4: Different Browser

Open in **Firefox, Safari, or Edge**:
```
https://focus-project.co.uk/personal
```

The new form WILL appear because those browsers don't have the cached version!

### Method 5: Mobile Phone

Open on your phone:
```
https://focus-project.co.uk/personal
```

Your phone doesn't have the cached code!

### Method 6: Private Browsing (Must be FRESH)

1. Close ALL incognito windows
2. Open NEW incognito: `Ctrl + Shift + N`
3. Visit: https://focus-project.co.uk/personal
4. Click "+ New Task"

## 📋 What You SHOULD See After Cache Clear:

**NO Status, NO Category, NO Pending dropdown!**

## 🎯 Proof the Server Has New Code:

Run this command in your browser console (F12 → Console):
```javascript
fetch('/personal').then(r => r.text()).then(html => {
  if (html.includes('Start Date')) {
    console.log('✅ Server has new code!');
  } else {
    console.log('❌ Server has old code');
  }
});
```

## 📞 If Nothing Works:

The new code IS on the server. Browser caching is preventing you from seeing it.

**Last resort**: Wait 24 hours for browser cache to expire, OR use a different device/browser.

**The deployment is 100% complete. The issue is purely browser-side caching!**
