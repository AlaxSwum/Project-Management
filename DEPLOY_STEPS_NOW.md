## ‚ö° STEP 2: Deploy Frontend (I CAN HELP)

Your frontend code is ready. Choose your deployment method:

### Option A: Vercel/Netlify (Recommended)

If your project is connected to Git:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add completion checkbox to content calendar"
git push origin main
```
Your hosting will auto-deploy!

### Option B: Manual Build & Upload

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

Then upload the `build` or `.next` folder to your hosting.

### Option C: Direct Hostinger Deploy

If you have a deploy script:

./deploy-to-hostinger-now.sh
```
