## 🔴 WHY YOU DON'T SEE CHANGES:

**Your browser cached the old JavaScript files!**

The server IS serving new code, but your browser won't download it because it thinks it already has the latest version.

## ✅ SOLUTION - DO THIS NOW:

### Method 1: Hard Reload (FASTEST)

1. Go to: https://focus-project.co.uk/personal
2. Press `F12` (open DevTools)
3. Right-click the refresh button
4. Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**
5. Close DevTools
6. Click "+ New Task"

### Method 2: Clear Site Data (BEST)

**Chrome:**
1. Go to: `chrome://settings/content/all`
2. Search: `focus-project.co.uk`
3. Click the trash icon next to it
4. Close ALL tabs
5. Visit: https://focus-project.co.uk/personal

**Firefox:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cookies and Site Data"
3. Select "Cached Web Content"
4. Click "Clear"
5. Visit: https://focus-project.co.uk/personal

### Method 3: Incognito Window

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + N` (Chrome) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Firefox)
2. Visit: https://focus-project.co.uk/personal
3. Click "+ New Task"
4. You WILL see the new form!

### Method 4: Different Browser

- Open Safari, Firefox, or Edge
- Visit: https://focus-project.co.uk/personal
- The new form will appear!

### Method 5: Use Your Phone

- Open https://focus-project.co.uk/personal on your phone
- Your phone doesn't have the cached version
