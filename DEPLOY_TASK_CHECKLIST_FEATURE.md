```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

   - The item should appear below
   - Click the checkbox to mark it complete
   - Click "Remove" to delete an item

5. Create a task with checklist items
6. The checklist items should be saved along with the task

## How to Use

### Creating a Task with Checklist

1. Go to **Personal** page
2. Click **"+ New Task"**
3. Fill in the task details (title, description, etc.)
4. In the **"To-Do List"** section:
   - Type a checklist item (e.g., "Research competitors")
   - Click **"Add"** or press **Enter**
   - Repeat for each item you want to add
5. You can check items off even before creating the task
6. Click **"Create Task"** to save everything

### Managing Checklist Items

- **Add Item**: Type in the input field and click "Add" or press Enter
- **Check/Uncheck**: Click the checkbox next to an item
- **Remove Item**: Click the red "Remove" button next to an item
- **Reorder**: Items are displayed in the order you add them

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

New table: `task_checklist_items`
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `task_id`: Links to the task in projects_meeting table
- `user_id`: Owner of the checklist item
- `item_text`: The actual checklist item text
- `is_completed`: Boolean flag for completion status
- `item_order`: Order of items in the list
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- `updated_at`: Timestamp (auto-updated)

### Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled
- Users can only see/edit their own checklist items
- Checklist items are automatically deleted when the parent task is deleted (CASCADE)

### Frontend Changes

Updated file: `hostinger_deployment_v2/src/app/personal/page.tsx`
- Added `ChecklistItem` interface
- Added checklist state management
- Added functions: `addChecklistItem()`, `removeChecklistItem()`, `toggleChecklistItem()`
- Updated `createTask()` to save checklist items
- Added checklist UI to the task modal

## Troubleshooting

### Items not saving?
- Make sure you ran the SQL script in Supabase
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the `task_checklist_items` table exists in your database

### RLS Policy Errors?
If you get permission errors, try temporarily disabling RLS for testing:
```sql
ALTER TABLE task_checklist_items DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

Then re-enable it:
```sql
ALTER TABLE task_checklist_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Frontend not updating?
- Clear your browser cache
- Make sure you rebuilt the Next.js app (`npm run build`)
- Restart the PM2 process (`pm2 restart focus-project`)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
- [ ] Display checklist items when viewing task details
- [ ] Edit checklist items after task creation
- [ ] Drag-and-drop to reorder items
- [ ] Progress indicator (e.g., "3/5 items completed")
- [ ] Sub-tasks that can be promoted to full tasks
- [ ] Bulk operations (complete all, delete all)

## Support

If you encounter any issues, check:
1. Supabase logs for database errors
2. Browser console for frontend errors
3. PM2 logs: `pm2 logs focus-project`
