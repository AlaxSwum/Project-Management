-- SIMPLE FIX: DISABLE RLS FOR CLASSES TABLES
-- =====================================================
-- This completely disables Row Level Security to fix immediate issues
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor

-- Disable RLS completely on all classes tables
ALTER TABLE classes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE classes_folders DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE classes_members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE classes_participants DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Ensure your user (ID 50) has access
INSERT INTO classes_members (user_id, role) VALUES (50, 'admin') ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO NOTHING;

-- Grant all permissions to authenticated users
GRANT ALL ON classes TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON classes_folders TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON classes_members TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON classes_participants TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
