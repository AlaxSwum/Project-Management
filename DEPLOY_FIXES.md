# ðŸš€ Deploy Team Members & Meetings Fixes

## Fixed Issues âœ…
1. **Team Members showing as "0"** - Now displays actual names and emails
2. **Meetings not appearing** - Meetings now load and display correctly

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: SSH into Hostinger Server
```bash
# SSH into your server
ssh root@srv875725.hstgr.cloud

# Navigate to project directory
cd /var/www/project_management

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Restart the service
systemctl restart nextjs-pm

# Check status
systemctl status nextjs-pm
```

### Option 2: Use the Server Update Script (if on server)
```bash
# On the server, run:
cd /var/www/project_management
./server-update.sh
```

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Team Members Issue
**File:** `frontend/src/lib/api-compatibility.ts`
- Changed `data?.project_members` to `data?.members`
- Now correctly reads team members from the project data structure

### 2. Meetings Issue
**File:** `frontend/src/lib/supabase.js`
- Enhanced `getMeetings()` function with proper data enrichment
- Fixed `createMeeting()` to handle authentication and data structure
- Fixed `updateMeeting()` with proper data formatting
- Added proper `project_name`, `created_by`, and `attendees_list` fields

## Test After Deployment

1. Go to `https://srv875725.hstgr.cloud/timetable`
2. Click "Schedule New Meeting" button
3. **Team Members:** Select a project - you should now see actual team member names instead of "0"
4. **Meetings:** Create a meeting and check that it appears in the calendar/list view

## Verification Steps

âœ… **Team Members:** Shows names like "John Doe (john@example.com)" instead of "0"  
âœ… **Meetings:** Created meetings appear in both calendar and list views  
âœ… **Project Dropdown:** All accessible projects appear in dropdown  

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
```bash
# Check service logs
journalctl -u nextjs-pm -f

# Restart service
systemctl restart nextjs-pm

# Check if build was successful
cd /var/www/project_management/frontend
ls -la .next/
```
