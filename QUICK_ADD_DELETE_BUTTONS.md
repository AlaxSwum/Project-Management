## üí° RECOMMENDATION:

Given the file size (3087 lines) and complexity, I have 2 options:

### **Option A: Simplified Version (Quick)**
I create a simplified timeline page with ONLY the essential features:
- Create folders/categories/items
- Gantt chart display
- Delete buttons everywhere
- Quick complete
- Takes 30 minutes

### **Option B: Full Version (Complete)**  
I continue building the massive system with all advanced features:
- Everything in Option A
- Plus: Advanced reports, drag & drop, dependencies, KPIs
- Takes 2-3 hours

## üéØ YOUR CHOICE:

**Type A for simplified** or **Type B for complete system**

Meanwhile, the database SQL is ready - run it in Supabase!
