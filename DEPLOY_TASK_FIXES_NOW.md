## 🌐 Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Using cPanel File Manager (Recommended)
1. Log into your Hostinger cPanel
2. Open File Manager
3. Navigate to your domain's public_html directory
4. Upload the contents of `frontend/.next/` to your web directory
5. Replace existing files when prompted

### Option 2: Using FTP Client
1. Connect to your Hostinger FTP
2. Navigate to public_html
3. Upload `frontend/.next/*` files to your web directory

### Option 3: Git Deployment (if configured)
```bash
# If you have Git deployment set up on Hostinger
ssh your-username@your-server
cd /path/to/your/app
git pull origin main
npm run build
```

## 🔍 Files to Upload

The built files are located in:
```
/Users/swumpyaesone/Documents/project_management/frontend/.next/
```

Upload these directories/files:
- `static/` (entire directory)
- `server/` (entire directory)
- All other files in `.next/`

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

1. **Navigate to your personal task management page**
2. **Test Week View**:
   - Create a task in week view → Should appear immediately
   - Switch to month view, create task → Switch back to week view → Should appear
   - Switch to day view, create task → Switch back to week view → Should appear

3. **Test Task Operations**:
   - Update a task → Should reflect in all views
   - Mark task as complete → Should update in all views
   - Delete a task → Should disappear from all views

## 🎯 Expected Results

After deployment, you should see:
- ✅ Tasks created in any view appear correctly in week view
- ✅ No more disappearing tasks
- ✅ Consistent task state across all views (week/month/day)
- ✅ Task updates, status changes, and deletions work properly

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

If you still experience issues after deployment:
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
3. Verify all files were uploaded correctly
4. Check that the database connection is working
